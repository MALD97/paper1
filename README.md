# code for optimization function in paper 1
1. The code is mainly used to realize the blind sourses separation of liner mixture.
2. The sourses are assumed to employ nPSK modutioan.  However, in this version, it only for BPSK.  Before the code being used for the signal employing other nPSK modulation, it need some ajustment.
3. The theoretical basis of code comes from  the paper  S. Cruces, "Bounded Component Analysis of Noisy Underdetermined and Overdetermined Mixtures," in IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, vol. 63, no. 9, pp. 2279-2294, May1, 2015, doi: 10.1109/TSP.2015.2404312 and the  original version of code can be refered at https://personal.us.es/sergio/
4. This code is a simplified version of the original codeï¼Œ but more stable and more suitable for the application scenario in my paper.
